This reddit code challenge is as follows:

There are many chairs located at the bears house, and goldilocks needs to determine which chairs can hold her weight and have a porridge that is not too hot.  The stats of the chairs are provided in a text file, with each chair located on a separate line and each chair's values on a single line with a space between (chair capacity first, then porridge temperature). The weight minimum and porridge temperature maximum are provided on the first line.

```
Example
100 120
297 90
etc.
```

This was a quick challenge that did not require much logic.  The code can be certainly revised, many reddit users had shorter code.
