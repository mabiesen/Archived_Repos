# RedditChallenge296Inter-GO

Goal of the challenge is to find the area of overlap for two rectangles with cartesian coordinates provided by the user.

I opted to use struct for the rectangles as a test of functionality.
I opted to prompt users for only two points to define a rectangle instead of four for the sake of brevity.

I am certain the code can be shortened.  
Rather than function calls, I would like to see left, bottom, top, and right values provided at the time of rectangle initiation.
Checks for terminal input could be made into a function.
