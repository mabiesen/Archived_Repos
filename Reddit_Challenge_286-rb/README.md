Find 3 variable Zeckendorf solution to provided integers.

The challenge was to find the Zeckendorf solution to a set of given integers.  The Zeckendorf hypothesis states that any given non-Fibonacci integer can be created through the addition of two or more non-sequential Fibonacci integers.  

At this time the code is located in the prelim branch.  There is an error in the code which causes it to neglect certain numbers.  Investigating.
