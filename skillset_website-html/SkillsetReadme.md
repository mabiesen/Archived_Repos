# skillset_website-html
HTML page displaying skills, once as reference buttons and onces as timeline.

NOTE:  This code has only been tested in a Firefox browser.

Page mainly utilizes CSS and HTML, though a small amount of Javascript is included.

Page is intended to be highly interactive and display good CSS form.

This page is intended to be an ongoing effort.  Room for improvement includes adding dates to the timeline, providing greater control of page element positioning in smaller windows, the first line of the page can be moved closer to the top of the browser window, and providing links to projects at github and on other pages. A button can be added to hide all open "dropdowns" for ease of use.  Additionally, text can be completed/improved upon and testing in other browsers including mobile.

All files go in the same folder.
